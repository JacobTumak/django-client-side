# Django-Client-Side Homepage

Welcome to the documentation for the Django client-side dependencies app! This app allows you to manage client-side
JS/CSS dependencies for your Django project in a centralized manner. It provides a testable and executable set of
client-side app dependencies and offers template tags to easily include JS/CSS dependencies in your templates. You can
use local static resources or fetch dependencies from a CDN. The app supports various build tools or can work without
any build tool at all. Additionally, it allows you to define conditional dependencies for different build environments.

## Features
* Maintain client-side dependencies in one place (i.e., not scattered in templates).
* Provides testable, executable client-side app dependencies set.
* Template tags used to pull JS / CSS dependencies into templates.
* Local static resources and/or from CDN.
* Use any client-side build tools or none - demo app uses npm as JS package manager and build tool.
* conditional dependencies for different build environments
